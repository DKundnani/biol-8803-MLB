# Now that we have implement `PCA' from scratch, let's try with more dimensionality reduction methods. PCA is a linear dimensionality reduction method, 
# but real world data includes more non-linear information. `TSNE' and `UMAP' are the two most widely used algorithms for nonlinear dimensionality reduction.

# TODO: Implement `TSNE' and `UMAP' algorithms. It is not easy to implement those two algorithms from scratch, but python packages `sklearn' and `umap-learn' have already implemented
# `TSNE' and `UMAP' for us, use the functions in those packages and fill in the blank part of `tsne_op' and `umap_op'. Note that your implementation of `tsne_op' should be adjustable
# with regarding to hyper-parameter`perplexity', and your implementation of `umap_op` should also be adjustaboe with regarding to  `n_neighbors' and `min_dist'.
# Play around with hyper-parameters in TSNE(`perplexity') and UMAP(`n_neighbors', `min_dist') on counts_PBMC.csv data. Compare the results generated with different hyper-parameters, 
# briefly discuss how those hyper-parameters affect the final visualization results and find the set of hyper-parameters that can generate the best visualization

# Note: 
# 1. To run the code, you need to install one additional package: [umap-learn](https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
# 2. Different from hw2_1.py, we didn't include the normalization step for you. Don't forget to normalize the data before doing dimensionality reduction
# 3. ``TSNE'' and ``UMAP'' is computationally expensive, people usually reduce the dimensions of the data to around $30-100$ 
#    using ``PCA'' before they feed the data into ``TSNE'' and ``UMAP''. Make sure you do that too with your implementation.
# 4. plotting function is already provided as `plot_latent'.
